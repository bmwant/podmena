### Installation

```bash
$ pip install podmena
```

* Activate for current git repository

```bash
$ podmena add local
```

You can also replace `add` with a different alias

`activate` / `enable` / `install` / `on`

e.g. `podmena enable local`

* Activate globally for all repositories (works with git `2.9.1` and above)

```bash
$ git --version
$ podmena add global  # Aliases work here as well
```

* Deactivate it
```bash
$ podmena rm local
$ podmena rm global
```

You can replace `rm` with any of these available aliases

`remove` / `delete` / `deactivate` / `disable` / `off` / `uninstall`

e.g. `podmena deactivate local`

* Check current status if you not sure

```bash
$ podmena status
```

* And finally `podmena --version` and `podmena --help` in case you need more
details.

> **NOTE:** uninstalling globally will not remove hooks from repositories where
it was installed locally. You need to switch to that directory manually and uninstall it locally as well.
